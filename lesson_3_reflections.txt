When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: for example when I'm working from more than one computers or when other people are working on the same repository with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: perhaps someone else is pushing something to GitHub repository that I do not want in my own local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer: fork is a repo I clone in GitHub from another GitHub repo. Clone is a copy of any other repo. Branch is a new commit branching from its parent commit.
