What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer: git creates a hidden folder where a lot of metadata of the files in the original folder are. I need to do that in order to give Git some place to store the commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Answer: what ever is in the stating area will be committed. I'm not sure what is the added value.
